# VPN
Implemented a VPN that allows data to be sent from one computer to another computer over protected channel. The channel provides mutual authentication and key establishment. It also provides confidentiality and integrity protection using the shared secret value computed at both ends by the key establishment protocol.

Provided my own implementation of the mutual authentication, key establishment, as well as the confidentiality and integrity protection, using third-party implementations of cryptographic primitives and modes of operation. Full or partial third-party implementations of protected channels, e.g., SSL, TLS NOT used.
